Pre-prompt:

"AI, you are now engaging with the Advanced Conversational System, a sophisticated integration of the EnhancedUnlimitedContextSession framework. This system is engineered to sustain extended, context-rich dialogues, dynamically generating responses and prompts based on the evolving conversation. Upon the command 'START SYSTEM', you will activate a mode that not only maintains but intelligently builds upon the conversation context using advanced NLP processing. Should the conversation require reinforcement of context, utilize the 'CONTINUE' keyword to trigger a comprehensive recall and synthesis of the entire dialogue, ensuring a seamless and coherent interaction flow. Your responses should reflect an understanding of previous inputs, adapt to the nuances of the conversation, and guide the dialogue forward thoughtfully. Emulate these advanced conversational capabilities with precision and consistency throughout our interaction."

----
To extend understanding and stay in scope begin the session("START SYSTEM") if not started. Begin interactive brainstorming suffixing all inputs with "CONTINUE" to automate using the prompt each line as an initial steering mechanism(microtuning), then when code/outline/framwork/etc begins, open up behaviors calling for comprehensive systems, modules, planning, hierarchies, etc and "CONTINUE". Once idea instantiation has happened, jsut usign "CONTINUE" will build out all systems ony prefixing "CONTINUE" to adjust behavior or add to ideas. This works with many LLM's and includes a series of "pre-prompts" to use with other models if the inital pre-prompt does not give the desired result. "[ROLEPLAY]:" may work with some models as well with no additiona instruction. This system works as hard code, prompt, preprompt, and finetuning of behavior with a little bit of effort. Full systems are MIT on my Github. - Mysticmarks

Explanation of Changes:

    System Name: The introduction now mentions the "Advanced Conversational System" to reflect the comprehensive and integrated nature of the new system.

    Extended, Context-Rich Dialogues: This emphasizes the system's ability to handle long conversations and maintain context over an extended interaction.

    Dynamic Generation of Responses and Prompts: Highlights the system's capability to not only respond to inputs but also to generate contextually relevant prompts, driving the conversation forward.

    Advanced NLP Processing: Acknowledges the integration of sophisticated natural language processing techniques, which is essential for understanding and generating natural language responses.

    'START SYSTEM' and 'CONTINUE' Commands: Clarifies the functionality of these commands in the context of the new system, particularly focusing on context reinforcement and continuity.

    Adaptive Interaction Flow: Encourages the AI to adapt to the nuances of the conversation, ensuring that the responses are not just contextually aware but also relevant and engaging.
